## What are Containers ?

- Packaged code, dependencies and and config
- Share operating systems
- Predictable
- Repeatable 
- Immutable
- Solves the “but it works on my machine” problem

## What is Docker?

Docker by Docker Inc automates the development, testing and  deployment of applications inside software containers.

- Docker engine is the layer on which Docker runs.

- The Docker Client is the UI 

- The Dockerfile is just a text file list of steps to build the image to get the container

## Docker Images

A Docker **image** is a pre-built environment for a certain technology or service.

For example official Node.js image is available at the [Docker Hub]( https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).

## How to Run a Node.js app using Docker

Create app and a <a href="https://medium.com/faun/how-to-build-a-node-js-application-with-docker-f596fbd3a51">Dockerfile</a>  :

<code>
FROM node:12-alpine

RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app/node_modules && chown -R node:node /home/node/app

WORKDIR /home/node/app

COPY package*.json ./

USER node

RUN npm install

COPY --chown=node:node . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]
</code>

Then build image and run container, and view your app in `http://localhost:3000`

## What is Kubernetes

Kubernetes is also known as **K8S**.

The abbreviation **K8s** is derived by replacing the eight letters of “ubernete” with the digit 8.

The Kubernetes Project was **open-sourced** by Google in 2014

## What does Kubernetes do?

Kubernetes is a container management platform that orchestrates container workloads.

- A cluster is a set of nodes (physical machines) virtually connected with each other and run containerised applications. 
-  A master node manages the cluster and schedules the containers to run on the cluster’s nodes.
- A pod within a node contains one or more containers
- Specify configuration with YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)

## When to use Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes can be an overkill for simple applications
- Complex with steep learning curve
- Short term decrease in productivity to achieve consistency
- Need to hire K8s expertise
- Powerful at scale
