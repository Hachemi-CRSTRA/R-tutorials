# Introduction

This tutorial is aimed at those who would also like to use R for data analysis and business analytics.

This introductory level tutorial assumes you have already installed R and R studio and had a brief introduction to the R basics and R Markdown. 

From this R Markdown run each line of code (Ctrl + Enter) or code chunk (Ctrl + Shift +Enter) yourself or Knit -> Knit to HTML to read through the HTML version.

# Getting started in RStudio

Let's go to RStudio and the panes

1. Files
2. Console
3. Environment, History
4. Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer

## Running code in the Console

The Console is where you can execute single-line R commands. 
This line is called the command line.

 
  
Try `3 + 2` and `Enter`

 

R lets you save data by storing it inside an R object. Assign the number 5 to an object `abc_sum` with arrow assignment `<-` in the Console.  

**TIP** Shortcut for `<-` using **ALT "+" "-" (or OPTION "+" "-" for OSX)**



```{r calculator, eval=FALSE}
abc_sum <- 3 + 2
```

**TIP** R is case sensitive, and there are naming conventions for objects

 

What happens when you type `x` into the Console after assigning the value 5 to it? What do you see in the `Environment` pane?


 

## Opening and knitting an R Markdown file

Open `File -> New File -> R Markdown`  

 


Give your document a title, keep the default HTML option and press **ok**.  


 

This will open an `Untitled1` template, you have given your document a title, not saved it!  

 

Save your document as `Intro.Rmd`.

 

Now we will render our `R Markdown` to an HTML document using the `knit` button or shortcut **CONTROL + SHIFT + k (COMMAND + SHIFT + K for OSX**.

`knit` is a function from the `knitr` package.

> This function takes an input file, extracts the R code in it according to a list of patterns, evaluates the code and writes the output in another file. It can also tangle R source code from the input document.

**TIP** Open `Help -> Cheatsheets -> R Markdown Cheat Sheet` 

 


Follow the prompts to install any required R packages.

### Let's install and load the tidyverse 

We're going to use the metapackage collection of R packages `tidyverse`. 

 

```{r Load the tidyverse package}
# This is a code chunk. 
# We can write informative comments with a hash # at the start.
# Install the tidyverse using the install.packages() function.

# Don't forget, you need to install the package before you can use it. 
# Load the tidyverse using the library() function. 

# Run this line of code using Ctrl+Enter 
# or press the green arrow in the top right corner of the chunk to run!

```

 

```{r install and load tidyverse }
# install.packages("tidyverse") # Only run this the first time to install the package
library(tidyverse)
```

**TIP** Shortcut for running a line of code using **CTRL + ENTER (or COMMAND + ENTER for OSX)**

 

# Importing data

The data for this workshop is the [UCI Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

>The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

The unzipped `bank.csv` file is available at the same link:

https://github.com/kimnewzealand/R-tutorials/tree/master/Analytics


We can import this data using the `read_delim()` function from the `readr` package and assign `<-` the data to an object called `bank`.

Type ?read_delim in your console and read the Help documentation.

 

```{r import bank data}
# Assign the url of the path to the RAW bank.csv
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kimnewzealand/R-tutorials/master/Analytics/bank-full.csv"
# Use the read_delim function to read in the csv, column separated with ;
bank <- read_delim(url,delim=";")
```

 

# Descriptive Statistics

Let's explore the information in this dataframe `bank`.

Lots of objects in R are friendly to the `summary()` and `str()` functions. 

What's is the output of `str()` using object `bank`?

 

```{r structure bank}
str(bank)
```


 

## The fine art of wrangling

We often wish to manipulate the data in some way. This is variously known as data wrangling, data transformation or data manipulation.

### The pipe

To do this, we'll learn a very useful operator, the pipe `%>%` 

Piping makes code easier to read (arguably) and is used extensively in the `tidyverse`  

**TIP** Shortcut for `%>%` using **CTRL + SHIFT + M (or CMD + SHIFT + M for OSX)** 

The function takes one argument, an object called `<some data>`
  

`str(<some data>) `



But we could also `%>%` the data into the function.

`<some data> %>% str() `


 

## Data Manipulation

Let's use a data manipulation package is called `dplyr`, which is also part of `tidyverse`. 

`dplyr` uses verbs as functions and the pipe. 

Type ?`dplyr` in your console and read the Help documentation.

 

## Numeric Variables

Let's select a numeric variable and calculate descriptive statistics.

 

```{r age summary}
bank %>% 
      select(age) %>%  # use the select verb to select the age variable
      summary()
```


 

## Categorical Variables

Let's select a categorical variable and calculate descriptive statistics.

 

```{r job table}
bank %>% 
      select(job) %>%  # use the select verb to select the job variable
      table()  # create a contingency table with frequencies
```



```{r job prop table}
bank %>% 
      select(job) %>%  # use the select verb to select the job variable
      table() %>%  # create a contingency table with frequencies
      prop.table()  # create a contingency table with proportions
```

 

# Data Visualisation


## The structure of a ggplot

One R method of plotting data is with the `ggplot2` package, which comes with the `tidyverse`.

Create simple to complex plots with `ggplot2`  by adding layers.

 

We define a mapping with aesthetics function `aes()` to the variables within the `ggplot()` function to initialise the ggplot object.

```{}
<some data> %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = <column1>, y = <column2>))
```

 

Next we add another layer such as a geom (geometric object) to represent data points:

```{}
<some data> %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = <column1>, y = <column2>)) +
  geom_point() # add a scatterplot geom with geom_point() function
```

 

## Your  first ggplot

First create a `ggplot` object `p` 
 

```{r first ggplot }
# Create a ggplot with age and campaign; number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
p <- bank %>% 
      ggplot(aes(age,campaign)) + 
      geom_point() 
p
```

 

## What happens when you add colour to the points for the y variable

```{r adding colour}
# Add colour = y to the aesthetics
p <- bank %>% 
      ggplot(aes(age,campaign,colour=y)) + 
      geom_point() 
p
```



 

## Let's add some interactivity to the plot

 

```{r interactive ggplot, message=FALSE, fig.height=3}
# install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p, height = 350, width=350)
```

 

## Density plots

Let's view the distribution of a numeric variable with a density plot.

 

```{r density plot}
# Creat a density plot of the age variable by target variable y
bank %>% 
      ggplot(aes(age,colour=y)) + 
      geom_density()
```




 

## Bar plot 

Let's view a bar plot and add a title.

 

```{r ggplot geom_bar, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a barplot
bank %>% 
      ggplot(aes(y,fill=y)) +
      geom_bar() +
      ggtitle("Barplot of Clients who Subscribed to a Term Deposit (Yes/No)")
```

 

# Predictive Model - Logistic regression

Let's use the [caret R package](topepo.github.io/caret/index.html). According to the package website, there are over 200 models available within the `caret` framework.

> The caret package (short for _C_lassification _A_nd _RE_gression _T_raining) is a set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models. The package contains tools for:
data splitting
pre-processing
feature selection
model tuning using resampling
variable importance estimation
as well as other functionality.

```{r logistic regression, message=FALSE}
# Install caret package
# install.packages("caret")
library(caret)
# Remove the duration as per meta data, duration should be discarded to have a realistic predictive model
bank <- bank %>%  select(-duration)
# Create training and test sets using partitions
inTrain <-  createDataPartition(y = bank$y, # Vector of outcomes
                              p = 0.7, # Proportion of values in training set
                              list = FALSE) # Return a vector of indices
 
# Create training and test sets
training <-  bank[inTrain, ]
test     <-  bank[-inTrain, ]
# Train a logistic model on the training data set
model <- train(y ~ ., 
            data = training, 
            method = "glm", 
            family = "binomial")
```

 

## Model results

```{r model results}
# Plot the variable importance using ggplot.  The variable importance shows how the model's accuracy reduces as each variable is removed from the model
varImp(model) %>% 
      ggplot() + 
      geom_col()
# View the model results, given default model performance measures
model$results
```





 

# Survival tips

- Modern day coding practice comprises almost entirely searching "how do I do `x` in `language`".
- Type `?function` into the RStudio Console, and the Help pane will display documentation. 
- Cheatsheets online or in R-Studio Help menu
- Twitter
- Online forums such as stackoverflow
