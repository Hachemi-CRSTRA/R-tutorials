# Data Structure Types in R

<img src="http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/_images/dataStructuresNew.png" style="width:60%">

`Vectors`: one-dimensional arrays used to store data of the same type  
`Matrices`: two-dimensional arrays to store data of the same type  
`Arrays`: similar to matrices but they can be multi-dimensional  
`Factors`: vectors of grouped categorical variables   
`Lists`: ordered collection of objects, where the elements can be of different types  
`Data Frames`: generalization of matrices where different columns can store different data types

# Dataframes in R

In this workshop the datasets we will work with dataframes. 

The column names are variable names.

# How to run code in R?!

There are 2 ways of interacting with RStudio:  

1.  Files that contain your code

2.  Console

---

# What files do we save the code in?

## R Markdown

We can use [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html) files (instead of R scripts).

> R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:

> 1. For **communicating** to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.

> 2. For **collaborating** with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them ( i.e. the code).

> 3. As an environment in which to do data science, as a modern day lab **notebook** where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.

R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like HTML, PDFs, Word files, presentations, websites and more.

---

# Functions

The most common element of packages are functions. 

Functions run other people's code for us, so that we don't have to reinvent the wheel. 

Functions in R take the form `function(arguments)`.

R also comes preloaded with a `base` of functions commonly used. For a complete list of functions, use `library(help = "base")`.

In R, you'll often see functions called `closures`. This name reflects the fact that R functions capture, or enclose, their environments.

---

# R Packages

Packages are collections of other people's code. 

Often someone has already written a script that does what you want to do.

## For installation,  first time only

`install.packages("name of package")`

This function will install the package from  https://cran.r-project.org/ which is CRAN - The Comprehensive R Archive Network.

**Note** Some packages can also be installed from  https://github.com/
 
## Loading and attaching package

`library(name of package)`

---



# Environments in R

- The `Global Environment` is the user workspace  

- The `active environment` is the current environment. Typically this will be the same as the `Global Environment`.

- Each time R runs a function, it creates a new `runtime environment` to evaluate the function  
- R follows a special set of scoping rules to look up objects

The environments and packages on the search path are connected as shown in the environment tree. R will search environments and attached packages from left to right, to find the object.

# Objects in R

- R is object orientated

- In R environments, functions and dataframes are objects

- R saves an object in the active environment with the assign  `<-` arrow

- If the name exists already, R will overwrite it

# Descriptive Analytics

- Describing a view of past events  
- Also known as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Develop understanding and intuition of your data  
- Step before further data collection, data cleaning, data manipulations or modeling

## Descriptive statistics   

includes:

`mean`  
`standard deviation`  
`quartiles`  
`correlation`  
`unsupervised models`


## Data Visualisations  

includes:  

`scatterplots`   
`barplots`   
`histograms`  



---

# Predictive Analytics

Predict what could happen in a certain time frame ahead. 

An independent, target or y variable could either be:
- a numerical prediction or
- predict a binary outcome yes = 1 or no = 0 to a question



---

# Prescriptive Analytics

> Prescriptive methodologies not only look into the future to predict likely outcomes but they also attempt to shape the future by optimizing the targeted business objective while balancing constraints.

# Getting started in RStudio

Let's go back to RStudio and the panes

1. Files
2. Console
3. Environment, History
4. Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer

<center> <img src="https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/materials/01_collaborative-environment/images/rstudio-panes.png" style="width:55%"  /> </center>

---

## Running code in the Console

The Console is where you can execute single-line R commands. 
This line is called the command line.

--
  
Try `3 + 2` and `Enter`

--

R lets you save data by storing it inside an R object. Assign the number 5 to an object `x` with arrow assignment `<-` in the Console.  



```{r calculator, eval=FALSE}
x <- 3 + 2
```

**TIP** R is case sensitive, and there are naming conventions for objects

--

What happens when you type `x` into the Console after assigning the value 5 to it? What do you see in the `Environment` pane?


---

## Opening and knitting an R Markdown file

Open `File -> New File -> R Markdown`  

--

Follow the prompts to install any required R packages.  

--

Give your document a title, keep the default HTML option and press **ok**.  

--

This will open an `Untitled1` template, you have given your document a title, not saved it!  

--

Save your document as `Intro.Rmd`.

--

Now we will `knit` our document to an HTML document using the `knit` button or shortcut **control + shift + k**.

`knit` is a function from the `knitr` package.

> This function takes an input file, extracts the R code in it according to a list of patterns, evaluates the code and writes the output in another file. It can also tangle R source code from the input document.

---

## Get these notes

We will all work from a personal copy of these slides, accessed from GitHub. 

Clear the contents of your .Rmd file.

--

###  Find them yourself

Google `github kimnewzealand`   

Go to the **R-tutorials** in pinned repositories  
-> Analytics folder  
->  **2018-08_Workshop_Notes.Rmd**  
-> **Raw** button 

--

### or Navigate directly to this link
https://github.com/kimnewzealand/R-tutorials/Analytics 

--

Select all, copy and paste the text into your .Rmd file


---

### Let's install and load the tidyverse 

We're going to use the metapackage collection of R packages `tidyverse` to help us with our analysis. 

--

```{r Load the tidyverse package}
# This is a code chunk. 
# We can write informative comments with a hash # at the start.
# Install the tidyverse using the install.packages() function.

# Don't forget, you need to install the package before you can use it. 
# Load the tidyverse using the library() function. 

# Run this line of code using Ctrl+Enter 
# or press the green arrow in the top right corner of the chunk to run!

```

--

```{r install and load tidyverse }
# install.packages("tidyverse") # Only run this the first time to install
library(tidyverse)
```


---

# Importing data

The data for this workshop is the [UCI Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

The unzipped csv file is available at the url:

https://github.com/kimnewzealand/R-tutorials/Analytics


We can import this data using the `read_delim()` function from the `readr` package and assign `<-` the data to an object called bank.

--

```{r import bank data}
url <- "https://github.com/kimnewzealand/R-tutorials/Analytics"
setwd("~/R-tutorials/Analytics")
# Use the read_delim function to read in the csv, column separated with ;
bank <- read_delim("bank.csv",delim=";")
```

---

# Descriptive Statistics

Let's explore the information in this dataframe `bank`.

Lots of objects in R are friendly to the `summary()` and `str()` functions. 

What's is the output of `str()` using object `bank`?

--

```{r structure bank}
str(bank)
```


---

## The fine art of wrangling

We often wish to manipulate the data in some way. This is variously known as data wrangling, data transformation or data manipulation.

### The pipe

To do this, we'll learn a very useful operator, the pipe `%>%`. 

Piping makes code easier to read (arguably) and is used extensively in the `tidyverse`.  

**TIP** Shortcut for `%>%` using **CTRL + SHIFT + M (or CMD + SHIFT + M for OSX)** 

The function takes one argument, an object called `<some data>`
  

`str(<some data>) `



But we could also `%>%` the data into the function.

`<some data> %>% str() `


---

# Data Manipulation

Let's use a data manipulation package is called `dplyr`, which is also part of `tidyverse`. 

`dplyr` uses verbs as functions and the pipe. 

Type ?`dplyr` in your console and read the Help documentation.

---

## Numeric Variables

Let's select a numeric variable and calculate descriptive statistics.

--

```{r age summary}
bank %>% 
      select(age) %>%  # use the select verb to select the age variable
      summary()
```


---

## Categorical Variables

Let's select a categorical variable and calculate descriptive statistics.

--

```{r job table}
bank %>% 
      select(job) %>%  # use the select verb to select the job variable
      table()  # create a contingency table with frequencies
```



```{r job prop table}
bank %>% 
      select(job) %>%  # use the select verb to select the job variable
      table() %>%  # create a contingency table with frequencies
      prop.table()  # create a contingency table with proportions
```

---

# Data Visualisation


## The structure of a ggplot

One R method of plotting data is with the `ggplot2` package, which comes with the `tidyverse`.

Create simple to complex plots with `ggplot2`  by adding layers step by step.

--

We define a mapping with aesthetics function `aes()` to the variables within the `ggplot()` function to create the base plot.

```{}
<some data> %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = <column1>, y = <column2>))
```

--

Next we add another layer such as a geom (geometric object) to represent data points:

```{}
<some data> %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = <column1>, y = <column2>)) +
  geom_point() # add a scatterplot geom with geom_point() function
```

---

## Your  first ggplot

First create a `ggplot` object `p`:

--

```{r first ggplot }
p <- bank %>% 
      ggplot(aes(age,balance)) + 
      geom_point() 
p
```




---

## Let's add some interactivity to the plot

--

```{r interactive ggplot, message=FALSE, fig.height=3}
# install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p, height = 350, width=350)
```

---

## Density plots

Let's view the distribution of a numeric variable with a density plot.

--

```{r density plot}
bank %>% 
      ggplot(aes(age)) + 
      geom_density()
```



---

## Bar plot 

Let's view a bar plot and add a theme.

--

```{r ggplot geom_bar, message=FALSE}
#install.packages("ggthemes")
library(ggtheme)
bank %>% 
      ggplot(aes(contact)) +
      geom_bar() +
      theme_excel()
```

---

## Predictive Model - Logistic regression

```{r logistic regression}
bank <- bank %>%  
      mutate(y=recode(y,"no"=0,"yes"=1))
model <- glm(y~ ., bank, family = "binomial")
model %>% summary()
```





---

# Survival tips

- Modern day coding practice comprises almost entirely searching "how do I do `x` in `language`".
- Type `?function` into the RStudio Console, and the Help pane will display documentation. 
- Cheatsheets online or in R-Studio Help menu
- Twitter
- Online forums such as stackoverflow
